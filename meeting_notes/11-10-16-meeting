Notes for 11/17/16 Meeting with Boris 480 #4

Set up time to meet with Boris for practice presentation
-Rehearsal for 480 start 4:00PM

Ask Szilard if we will get specifics on presentation (We did in class)

Spend enough time to explain (in plain English) what the task is (what it does and purpose).

Outline what the challenges are (For the presentation / Power Point)
                -What kind of problems to be resolved (Write them out and show Boris)
                                -Do it from the customers perspective (Why is it important to the customer)
                                -Challenges from the CS perspective
                                                -we have a lot of UI which we can discuss
                                                                -“To address those challenges we made these designs. And these are
                                                                                the reason we choose these designs” (Or some version of this)
For rehearsal we will be in the auditorium he will sit in the back , so we NEED to learn how  to project our voices.
                -Practice our slides and performance so we can focus on what our bodies are doing (Focusing                    on looking at the audience, not turning back) and not what we have to say.
                -Make sure to mostly face the audience

Make sure that the transition between group members is smooth (Make sure you know when the previous members slide ends and where yours begins)

Look good and look like a team
                -Make sure to coordinate clothing so we look like a professional team.

Be prepared for the questions afterwards.
                -Generate questions ourselves and test other team members in practice (see how to handle     questions on the fly)
                -Make sure we hear the asked questions and clarify the questions to ensure giving the accurate                 answer. (If we are not 100% sure what the question pertains to, ask a follow up so we can           answer the question directly and specifically)
                -Be able to pass the question to a teammate if you think they can answer it more succinctly or   re more informed.

About the Actual Project:

PDF or Jpeg for actual input image into the software.

For future versions, implement a comment and questions section for the user. Maybe, write a question on the screen and leave a text input box for the user to leave a comment in.

For an initial implementation of the project (when testing the basic functionality of the software) use radio buttons to choose which class each graph is, until we can implement our final designs.
