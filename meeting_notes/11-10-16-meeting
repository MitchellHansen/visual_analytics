Notes for 11/10/16 Meeting with Boris 480 #3

Results for stats of the groups of access codes
-Show results for individual access code states as well as collective stats of groups of access codes

Remember training will be exactly the same as the real test in terms of format

WE NEED TO PRACTICE THE ACTUAL TESTS OURSELVES TO UNDERSTAND IT INTIMATLY. CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH

MAY create sets of modules based on difficulty [easy, medium, hard]. Also may give different groups different orders of difficulty. EX: Group1[E,M,H] Group2[M,E,H] Group3[H,E,M]

We should slice up each graph into sections (like 16 sections each 1/16th the size of the original image) And have the user click on the section that which, to them, most closely identifies it as being case 1 or case 2.
-Add a slider in the admins create a test section, which allows the admin to specify exactly how thick or or think they want the sections to be. So for example the slider starts at the left for a CPC graph. Being at the left means it creates 8 dividers each 45 degrees apart. If you more the slider, lets say half way, it changes to 16 divisors and they are each 22.5 degrees aparts.

-When clicking on a Graphs data segment (A section which will be divided up) it should become the same color as case one (RED). When clicked a second time it should become the same as case 2 (GREEN), and when clicked a third time it should revert to its original state (BLACK)

In the future we may the software may need to be able to implement different types of tests. Not just data recognition.

How to generate Access codes:
-Maybe take the date from the computer and manipulate it to give some code
-Maybe rng for code
-Maybe take the current date Nov 10 2016 and add four random digits afterwards so it would become ex: 111016WXYZ

Make some sort of key generator button on the admin page.

Try to find some way to send codes via email and send mass emails which send unique codes to specific emails. [This stills needs to be fleshed out if it is to actually be a feature]
