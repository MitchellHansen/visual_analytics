####Goal of Visual Analytics

  - Allows users to take tests 
  - Drag and drop files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

####Discription
Dr. Kovalerchuk has requested our aid to build software which allows users to take tests, which are traditionally paper based, and gather various data points from said testing. This will be done by comparing each graph on the screen with two classes and determining which class each belongs to. The intent, which so happens to be our tag line is, by testing different models of multidimensional data representations, we can promote the most effective models for Visual Analytics.
