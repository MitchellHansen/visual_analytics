####Goal of Visual Analytics

  - Allows users to take tests 
  - Drag and drop files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
